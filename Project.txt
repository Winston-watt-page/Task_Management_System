A task management tool similar to JIRA with role-based permissions and sprint management.

USER ROLES & GROUPS:

1. Admin
   - Registers with username and password
   - Creates and manages groups
   - Adds users to the system
   - Defines and assigns permissions to each group
   - Has access to backlog page containing main tasks/projects

2. TL (Team Lead)
   - Assigned when creating sprints
   - Communicates with team members to gather due dates
   - Has permission to start the sprint

3. Scrum Master
   - Works with Admin to plan sprints
   - Assigns modules/tasks to developers
   - Performs daily status updates
   - Tracks who is making progress and what has been completed

4. Developer
   - Works on assigned tasks
   - Sets their own due dates for assigned tasks
   - Updates task status (To Do, Progress, Completed)
   - Views assigned tasks on their dashboard

5. Tester
   - Tests completed tasks
   - Updates task status
   - Can change task states based on testing results

TASK WORKFLOW STATES:

- To Do
- Progress (In Progress)
- Completed

COMPLETE WORKFLOW:
-----------------

1. ADMIN SETUP:
   - Admin registers and logs into the system
   - Admin creates groups (Admin, TL, Scrum Master, Developer, Tester)
   - Admin adds users to the system and assigns them to groups
   - Admin defines permissions for each group

2. PROJECT/TASK CREATION:
   - Main tasks/projects appear in Admin's backlog page
   - Example: "Task Management System" as main project

3. SPRINT PLANNING:
   - Admin and Scrum Master discuss manually
   - Break down main task into different modules
   - Each module is considered as a different sprint
   - Assign modules/sprints to different developers
   - TL (Team Lead) is assigned/defined at the time of sprint creation

4. TASK ASSIGNMENT:
   - Tasks become visible on assigned person's page/dashboard
   - Assigned person (developer) provides the due date
   - Each team member can see their backlog on their dashboard

5. SPRINT EXECUTION:
   - TL starts the sprint
   - Assignees can change task status:
     * To Do → Progress → Completed
   - Team members work on their assigned tasks

6. DAILY UPDATES:
   - Scrum Master updates daily status
   - Tracks who is making progress
   - Monitors what has been completed
   - If deadlines change and progress is not made, Scrum Master tracks and reports

KEY FEATURES:
------------
- Role-based permissions system
- Sprint management with TL assignment
- Backlog pages for Admin and individual users
